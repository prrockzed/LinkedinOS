### How to Contribute:

1. **Create an Issue**

   Before starting any contribution, please create an issue using one of the [Issue Templates](https://github.com/prrockzed/chessed/issues/new/choose). Clearly explain the issue or feature you want to work on. We will review it and decide if it fits the project needs. Once approved, the issue will be assigned to you, and you can start working on it.

2. **Fork the Repository**

   Fork the repository to your own GitHub account to start working on your contribution.

3. **Clone the Repository**

   Clone the forked repo to your local machine to start coding. The following command will clone the repository to your current folder.

   ```sh
   # Replace <...> with your github username and repository name
   git clone https://github.com/<YOUR GITHUB USERNAME>/<REPOSITORY_NAME>.git
   ```

4. **Create a New Branch**

   Create a branch for your feature or bug fix.

   ```sh
   # replace feature-name with the feature or issue name you're working on
   git checkout -b feature-name
   ```

5. **Make your changes and commit**

   After implementing your changes, commit them with a meaningful message that describes your work.

   ```sh
   # stage your changes
   git add .
   ```

   ```sh
   # write a meaningful commit message concluding your feature
   git commit -m "Added some feature"
   ```

6. **Push the changes**

   Push your branch to your forked repository.

   ```sh
   git push origin feature-name
   ```

7. **Open a pull request**

   Once your changes are pushed, open a Pull Request (PR) to the main repository. Make sure to link the issue you've been assigned in the PR description.

8. **PR Approved**
